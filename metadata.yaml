description: 'Hamilton Cleek is a renaissance man for the ages: an intellectual giant
  with the brawn of ten men, he serves as a consulting detective, often helping Scotland
  Yard with particularly challenging cases. In The Riddle of the Spinning Wheel, Cleek
  finds himself at the center of a confounding whodunit. Will this be the mystery
  that finally pushes him over the edge?'
